# Imperium

**Imperium** is a general purpose imperative programming language being developed to apply my learning outcomes from programming language theory and compiler design. It is biased towards compiled, high-performance applications which may use cache optimizations, inlining, multithreading, and GPGPU. But it is meant to be as syntactically simple as possible. 
It is currently intended for transcompilation to C.

It is named after the Ancient Roman law that grants Roman curule magistrates absolute **power to command**. This relates to the level of control and efficiency that the programming language is intended to have on the hardware.
